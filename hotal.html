<h1> fact</h1>
<P>    fact about Japan hotels:
    In many Japanese hotels, there are separate pajamas provided for guests to wear during their stay.
     These comfortable, often stylish outfits are called "yukata" and are worn by guests while lounging in their rooms or even when visiting traditional hot spring baths located within the hotel premises.
      This unique practice enhances the cultural experience of staying in a Japanese hotel and makes guests feel more immersed in the local traditions
